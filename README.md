# Melanoma Detection Assignment
Problem statement

To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information

This is an assignment as part of UpGrad MS program in ML & AI

To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Conclusions
Initially I tried without the ImageDataGenerator which created data to over fit at high ratio

Then I introduced dropout and ImageDataGenerator which reduced the over fit

At last I tried Batch Normalization and Augumentation which really helped in carry forward
